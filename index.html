        <h1>Organic food</h1>
        <p>
          <span class="bold"> Organic food</span> is grown without the use of
          synthetic chemicals, such as human-made pesticides and fertilizers,
          and does not contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Organic
          foods include fresh produce, meats, and dairy products as well as
          processed foods such as crackers, drinks, and frozen meals.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="bold">The benefits of organic food</span>
          How your food is grown or raised can have a major impact on your
          mental and emotional health as well as the environment. Organic foods
          often have more beneficial nutrients, such as antioxidants, than their
          conventionally-grown counterparts and people with allergies to foods,
          chemicals, or preservatives may find their symptoms lessen or go away
          when they eat only organic foods.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="bold">Organic produce contains fewer pesticides.</span>
          Chemicals such as synthetic fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides
          are widely used in conventional agriculture and residues remain on
          (and in) the food we eat.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="bold">Organic food is often fresher</span> because it
          doesn’t contain preservatives that make it last longer. Organic
          produce is sometimes (but not always, so watch where it is from)
          produced on smaller farms nearer to where it is sold.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="bold"
            >Organic farming tends to be better for the environment.</span
          >
          Organic farming practices may reduce pollution, conserve water, reduce
          soil erosion, increase soil fertility, and use less energy. Farming
          without synthetic pesticides is also better for nearby birds and
          animals as well as people who live close to farms.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="bold"
            >Organically raised animals are NOT given antibiotics, growth
            hormones, or fed animal byproducts.</span
          >
          Feeding livestock animal byproducts increases the risk of mad cow
          disease (BSE) and the use of antibiotics can create
          antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Organically-raised animals
          tend to be given more space to move around and access to the outdoors,
          which help to keep them healthy.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="bold"
            >Organic meat and milk can be richer in certain nutrients.</span
          >
          Results of a 2016 European study show that levels of certain
          nutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids, were up to 50 percent higher
          in organic meat and milk than in conventionally raised versions.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="bold">Organic food is GMO-free.</span> Genetically
          Modified Organisms (GMOs) or genetically engineered (GE) foods are
          plants whose DNA has been altered in ways that cannot occur in nature
          or in traditional crossbreeding, most commonly in order to be
          resistant to pesticides or produce an insecticide.
